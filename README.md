# web_marketing_project


The main goal of this project is to answer to the following Business Questions:

- In which RFM categories should the customer base be divided?
- For each client, which is the probability to churn?
- Are there products that are often sold together and could potentially give insights about customer behaviours?


The Project Pipeline follows these steps:

- Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- Explorative Analysis
- RFM Model
- Churn Model
- Market Basket Analysis
